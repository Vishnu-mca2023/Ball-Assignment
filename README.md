# Ball Movement

Project Description:

This HTML document features a red ball that moves diagonally across the screen. The ball's position is controlled by JavaScript, and it bounces between the top-left and bottom-right corners of the viewport. The animation speed and direction are adjusted through variables, creating a continuous back-and-forth motion. Additionally, an external stylesheet named "styles.css" is linked, but its content is not shown here.
